This site is made with MDwiki and with the help of the repository "proto site" of my classmate Ioannis Protonotarios.

## I am Akrivi Papazoglou
 I study "Social Information Systems" at the Open University of Cyprus and this web page is part of my first assignment for the course "Information in Social Systems". 
 
 Through this web page I have decided to introduce myself and share with you my bio and also things about me.

 Even when I finish this project I intend on enriching it and make my personal branding platform.


## About me 
I live and work in Athens and I love reading and traveling.

From 2003 I am a volunteer for the Youth Organization of my city, where I began as a writer/editor with the newsletter, assisted in producing various special events, and have been active in volunteer recruitment and web site management.
Also, I have been able to be part of a team responsible for the overall organisation of community events, fundraisers, concerts and many other activities for all citizens.

I always enjoy and seek the company of my friends and one of my favorite things is going to the movies.
