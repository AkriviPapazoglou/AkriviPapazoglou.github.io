##Credits and acknowledgments

Ioannis Protonotarios made a website that makes sites 

the site's pages are not written in html but in markdown, the language in GitHub that looks like natural text.

I relied on both the operating MD wiki and also in the very structure of GitHub.

The project is named «proto-site» and you will find it here: protonotarios.github.io/proto-site
