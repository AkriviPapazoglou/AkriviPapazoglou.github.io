##Credits and acknowledgments
Ioannis Protonotarios made a website that makes sites. The site's pages are not written in html but in markdown, the language in GitHub that looks like natural text. He relied on both the operating MD wiki and also in the very structure of GitHub. His project is named «proto-site» and you will find it here: protonotarios.github.io/proto-site
